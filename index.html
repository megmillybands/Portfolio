                <p id="about-me-text-1">I come from a family with a passion for the creative arts, so it's no surprise that I ended up much the same way. I have a very creative mind. I've always enjoyed painting, crocheting, sewing, embroidery... Pretty much any creative activity you can think of, I have tried it at least once. The process of gathering miscellaneous materials and turning it into something somewhat decent looking is a very rewarding experience. For me, writing a program or designing a webpage scratches that same itch in my creative brain.</p>
                <p id="about-me-text-2">My love for programming didn't develop overnight. My father was a programmer, and his father was also a programmer. Naturally, my father passed the torch to me. So I picked up one of his old HTML textbooks, and the rest is history.</p>
