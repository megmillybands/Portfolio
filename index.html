I've always enjoyed painting, crocheting, sewing, embroidery... Pretty much any creative activity you can think of, I have tried it at least once. The process of gathering miscellaneous materials and turning it into something somewhat decent looking is a very rewarding experience. For me, writing a program or designing a webpage scratches that same itch in my creative brain.</p>
